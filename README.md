# Number-Guessing-Game
This is my first project and this is build on java language , enjoy playing

# Rules of the game

The computer generates a random number between 1 to 100 and you need to guess the number
If your guess is greater than the number by 10 or lower than the number by 10 - the system will output 'Cold'
If your guess is within a + / - 10 range from the number, the system will output 'Hot'
You have unlimited attempts.
